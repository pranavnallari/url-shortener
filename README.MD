# URL Shortener API

This project is a URL shortener API built in Go using the Fiber web framework and Redis for database storage. It provides functionality to shorten long URLs into shorter, more manageable ones, and also includes a simple rate limiting feature.

To run this, you need docker installed on your machine.
